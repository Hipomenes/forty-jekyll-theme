The fundamental aim of my artistic research is to probe into authentic affective states beyond linguistic and intellectual articulation. I’m not really interested in everyday life, story telling   or   representation—nor in art as a social messenger. I’m   interested   in   the   “states”   that   can   be   attained   through movement and imagination when everyday consistency collapses. The direct experiences that call into question the very reality of things is my true object of interest. And I’m convinced that  the  investigation  of  movement,  through  improvisation  and  dance  making,  is  the  most effective  way  of  disclosing  the  field  of  micro-perceptions  and  affects  that  lie  behind  our everyday certainties.

     

I'm  interested  in  exploring  dance  potential  to  articulate  aesthetic  and  affective experiences  of  the  ineffable,  and  thus  approximate  embodied  philosophy,  mysticism  and contemplation.   I   care   about   what   remains   beyond   articulation,   and   I   conceive   the performative  experience  as  a  space  of  risk  and  stake  that  unveils  what  typically  remains inaccessible  to  us:  a  gentle  visit,  a  constant  invitation  to  question  paradigms  and  absolutist notions  of  self  and  reality.  I’m  interested  in  affective,  bodily,  time  and  spatial  affects  that emerge from the frequentation of mystery through movement. 

     

For me, art and dance are not mere activities, but rather life’s very impetus. They are experiences  that,  by  defying  the instrumentality  of  everyday  life,  paradoxically  reaffirm  it. The  study  and  reflection  on  the  contemporary the  creative  process and its various ramifications, conducted in tandem with actual production, is one of the hallmarks of my work.

     

## A Minimalist Artist Statement

     

     

    I  move

    I  think  

    I  observe

    I  listen 

    - I show  up- 

      I am  a  mother,  

    I  approach  the  practice with  care  and  respect 

     I  want  to  guide  the  work  into  learning  to  speak  for  itself 

    I make dances 

    I aim high 

    I fail a lot

     I’ll keep trying



    About Improvisation

    I have come to conceive and understand improvisation as a contemplative practice of conscious  interaction  with  the  world  and  as  a  field  of  everything.  Where  everything  is possible.  Where  through  indagatory  and  successive  endless  choice,  action  and  renounce  we reach  an  epiphanic  state  in  which  the  essential  joy  of  being  alive  and  the  true  non  dualistic nature  of  the  mind  becomes  actualized  potential. A  state  where  the  concrete  and  the  elusive converge,  and  what  we  don’t  know  becomes  familiar,  becomes  possibility  and  intuition.  No separation  between  impression  and  expression.  Through  improvisation  I  have  come  to completely trust the body and it’s epistemic nature; and I have come to know, to really know, in the way that you can only know through embodied experience; that reality is layered. That there are a lot of ways of being in the world. This is a virtuosic realization. I  notice  the  resistance  that  occurs  when  I  imply  that  I’m  trying  to  move  away  from making a distinction between set movement and improvisation. There is the expectation that set movement moments are to be immaculate and impermeable, and that improvisation is to be formless. This is problematic for me now. I feel that distinction is no longer useful for me as a dancemaker. I  try to  use  every  possible  mode  of  working,  of  generating and accesing. I'm not really interested anymore in these common places and arguments.


    … 

    But at least there’s the work and all of it’s miraculous otherworldly possibilities. We get to unveil what has never been and we dare it to exist with the light touch of our pinky finger. The afforded risk attempts to heal our deepest wounds

    ...

    The creative process can sometimes feel only as a space of dialogue and negotiation with one’s own attachment and expectations. There is no <ready state> available for taking a plunge into what life chooses to reveal on a particular moment and place.

    Some questions

     

    What is worth attempting? 

    What is really worth attempting? 

    What is absolutely necessary to attempt?

    What is not?

    What if I do what is not first, could that bring me back to what it is?

     

    Should I avoid precision and accuracy?

                                                             

                                                   Thought is not useful without action

         

    Actions before thought

                                                       What if thinking is doing?

             

     Making is thinking
                                                                             Making is enough

    .....


    Sometimes  I  worry  that  I’m  succumbing  to  the  demands  of  the  work,    I  have  to constantly  rethink  my  motivation,  reinforce  it,  and  I  have  to  constantly  release  it  as  well. Soften  it,  otherwise  it  makes  me  crazy.  Authorship  is  another  belief  that  we  work  hard  to deconstruct. 

                                         Is it wrong if I allow the work to completely run me over? I want to let it...



    To the performers

    [...]  this strange  and  wonderful  thing  we  are  making  just  founded  on  our  common agreement  of  being  together  and  exploring  what  this  togetherness  can  unveil.  It’s  getting really hard to remember how once upon a time I felt I needed something more.

    Notes about meaning


    How  to  remain here?  in this  place  where  things  seem  so  far  away  from  their inescapable fate of reaching meaning. Things are still just things. No success, no failure, only latency; only the facing of an ocean of possibilities that lead nowhere.


    I have a problem with theatricality, I’ve always had. I like to be a moving body that at moments  has  a  name,  I  hate  representing  or  expressing,  I  can  only  be  myself. But  I  must confess there is something about artifice that I’m beginning to be very attracted to. As long as it’s in conversation with it’s opposite. As long as it is a conscious choice and we all know that we  are  playing  that  game. As  long  as  we  all  know  that  is  artifice. As  long  as  it  doesn’t  say: This  is  what  it  is.  This  is  what  it  means.  This  is  what  is  important  about  this  thing. NOt much to do about that

     
     It has always been the other way around for me but it is just now that I’m learning to articulate it. That meaning doesn’t come first and that abstraction is not the obfuscation of solidity but rather a portal to transcendence; a suggestive gesture that opens a doorway leading to the undeliverable, the unsubstantial; the unattainable hence inexhaustible possibility for meaning. 

                                             something-everything-nothing- nothing-something-everything

     
    The embodiment of emptiness

     
                                                                     A thing is many things

     
                                                         AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM 

    Let’s embrace the -no sense—I could really use a break from intelligibility. I can’t stand facts. I only care about what is underneath
